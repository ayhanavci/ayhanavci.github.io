## Introduction

The list of most of the projects I have worked on starting from year 2000 till the end of year 2017 in various companies. I have decided to document them so there can be a reference when I'd like to look back, perhaps while talking to collegues. The actual project names will not be displayed here openly and the description will be very brief. In some projects I had additional roles such as Lead Dev, PM, Analysing, Designing, Testing etc. But in all projects, I have actively participated in coding. My [Tumblr page here](http://ayhanavci.tumblr.com/) describes my roles in projects.
