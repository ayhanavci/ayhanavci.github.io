# Introduction

I have been exploring software architecture patterns, and paid some attention to microservices which has been a hot topic for the past couple of years. I took some notes while researching and wrote some pseudo code. As I went deeper into subject, I kept on writing some small pieces of code along with my notes. Eventually I thought, why not design and code a working microservice? And here we are. I do not intend to explain everything about microservices. Just summarize some topics. This is not a theoric article but I am going to explain and document the design and briefly explain some of the technologies and the source code.

## Goals

* Design and implement common Microservice concepts. Implementation should be a fully functional.

* Lean, proof of concept grade source code as opposed to production grade.

* Keep the business model simple. This is about the technology, not the business domain.

* Use wide variety of technologies, programming languages to demonstrate the atomic and flexible nature of microservices.

* Avoid using any technology or ready solutions specific to microservices. Only use general use technologies. All libraries and platforms should also be free to use.

* Implement a basic event store, api gateway, various web services and multiple consumers.

* Test and upload the source code with its documentation.

## Structure

* The software patterns and then the Microservices concepts are going to be summarized.

* The design of the prototype will be explained with visuals.

* The modules will be explained.

## Source Code

(TODO)

# The Theory

## Software Architecture Patterns

Architecture pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture. These are not to be confused with [Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns). Design patterns are a piece of code in your project, architectural pattern is the design and structure of your software as a whole. There could be multiple design patterns and architectural patterns in your project.

Various architecture patterns are:

* Monolithic: The software is composed in one piece, with tightly coupled modules.
* Layered: Same as monolithic but the application is divided into components, developed in a horizontal fashion. The layers usually only communicate with the adjacent components. Great for embedded.
* N-Tier: Very similar to layered architecture. But implies that it can be distributed so the components can run on different machines as different instances. Most typical is 3-tiered architecture with Presentation - Business - Data layers.
* Event driven architecture: Event driven defines the communication model between components of the software. Events could be in the form of user events, socket events, IO completion ports, pipes etc. Event driven architecture could be in Broker pattern or in Mediator pattern. Broker pattern provides a medium in which the components can talk to each other but doesn't interfere with the business logic. Mediator pattern usually includes a controller which orchestrates events between components. Event driven architecture also includes patterns such as Publish/Subscribe and Topic. Most of these patterns are used within the prototype project.
* Microkernel: Your software has a bare skeleton that works, and it allows seperate modules get attached to it. In essence, this is a plugin system. Like the old Winamp plugins, or Eclipse, Visual Studio etc. all of which has a plugin market. There are also operating systems based on microkernel architecture.
* Model-View-Controller (and Model-View-Template): A very popular pattern mostly used in web development. Popular frameworks such as .NET and Django employ these patterns. The code is seperated into model, view and controller components. Model deals with the database, usually with an ORM like Entity Framework. View with the presentation to the user, usually html with a syntax like Razor. And the Controller has the business logic in it. This pattern could be considered monolithic & layered in nature since it is usually within a single project and source code is seperated into layers. But the layers in MVC/MVT are not as strict since they all tend communicate with each other.
* Various other patterns are; Blackboard, Pipes and Filters, Peer-to-Peer, Web Queue Worker, Client-Server, Space-based, Event Bus, CQRS, Microservices. Last three will further be explained below.

(TODO: Visual representations of some of the patterns)

Some of the patterns naturally includes others. Some are obselete, some are modern. I don't think there is a consensus on the whole list, even among the same organization. For instance some Microsoft articles have very different pattern list than the others.

## Microservices

Microservice architecture is a software architectural style focusing on building single function modules with well defined interfaces and operations.
Microservices divides the solution into business atomic modules, and helps create a flexible and scalable product. In microservices, the modules of the end product (services) are distinct and loosely coupled or even completely decoupled. Since there is no single monolithic application, and thanks to decoupling nature, it is easier to continue evolving your product by adding more seperately developed components. Compared to more traditional styles, microservices approach tend to work better for agile and devops.

### Monolithic

Monolithic architecture is developing your solution as self-contained, one piece application and with tightly coupled components. They have their advantages over microservices or other change friendly systems for well defined, low change products. If you are developing a very strictly designed application, agile and distributed approach is unnecessary and costly. For instance if you are developing an embedded software, or a well defined one such as a classic text editor, disc clean up tool or even an operating system itself, it tends to be cleaner, faster and cheaper to work good old Waterfall project management & Monolithic software architecture. Agile PM, Devops and change friendly architectures such as Microservices shine when the business demands continuous change and either the business domain or the technology has a lot of unknowns.

### Distributed

Distributed systems is an umbrella term for various software solutions. In essence it means your solution has distinct parts and modules running on seperate machines / platforms. They could be loosely coupled or decoupled. Microservices are distributed in essence. You could have 20 databases and 20 Rest services running on 80 machines, load balancing with each other.

### Domain Driven Design

Domain Driven Design is an approach to developing software systems, and in particular systems that are complex, that have ever-changing business rules, and that you expect to last for the long term within the enterprise. In addition to standart software development literature, you add concepts like Ubiquitous Language that help with communication, Aggregates that helps with seperation of modules, Domain Events, Value Objects etc. It is an approach that can be used for any project, but particularly well suited for Microservices since it is mostly about atomizing the solution.

### Decomposition and Aggregates

Divide and conquer strategy for domain driven design. You break the domain down into subdomains and define the relationship between them. This helps understanding and defining the parts and the steps of your software solution, and create a stable, modular system. In the end, decomposition outputs aggregates and services.

## Service Discovery and Service Registration

Microservices are a combination of service aggregates. The architecture being modular and flexible creates a context that any service could be added to the system from any location at any time. The consumers of these services should be able to find these services and use them for their intended purposes. This requires an API gateway in which consumer applications can meet with the services.
To solve this requirement, a service needs to be discovered. You could either design your environment so that each and every service is dicovered from a central mechanism, or each service sends their information (ip, port, etc.) whenever they are up and running. There are several premade solutions for this such as [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) or [Apache Curator](https://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/index.html).

## Reverse Proxy

One of my goals was building a lean and concept grade Microservice. So I wouldn't use any ready to use service discovery or registry solutions. One could be implemented from scratch but I just wasn't interested. So reverse proxy seemed like a good enough replacement for such technologies. Basicly you use an http server as your central API gateway and configure it so that distributed consumer requests are delivered to appropriate services that could be running on anywhere on the network / internet. More details later.

## Event Bus

Event bus is a software architecture pattern which allows the parts of your solution communicate with each other without having to know each other's location (or even existence). Event bus is a general purpose medium with a well defined protocol and communication model which parts of your software agrees on. Instead of directly sending events to each other's location, they send it to the event bus and whoever is interested in the event retrieves it. [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) is perfect for such solutions. And it was within my goals criteria since it is totally a generic purpose, popular and free solution. More on that later.

## CQRS

At its core, Command & Query Responsibility Segregation is seperating read and write operations. The idea is that recording a data should have no side effect on how you read it and vice versa. I am not going to discuss it here since it is not the goal and I am not an expert. But in practice this approach may seperate read and write databases themselves and the structure of the data on each database. When recording data, Event Sourcing usually goes together with CQRS pattern.

### Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a way of persisting your application's state by storing the history that determines the current state of your application. You record everything that has occured in a stack fashion, like a log file. So instead of physically updating an existing data, you make a new record with the updated fields. You gather the state of your objects / business logic, by combining these recorded events. This allows new ways to perform rollback transactions and data audit. Recording the data becomes very simple and high performance. 

### Event Store Pattern

Event store is a type of database system, optimized for storage of events. The data stored here never gets updated or deleted. The state changes of the objects required by the domain is handled by adding more events on top of the stack. For our purposes, it is the implementation of the Event Sourcing pattern. It has a record focused database and provides API for the services that may want to use the store.

### Database Per Service

Each service having its own database helps decoupling them. The output of decomposition are the service aggregates. And the database related to each aggregate only needs some of the whole data of the system. So it makes sense to create a small part of the full database. CQRS pattern along with an event bus helps us keep the data distributed and relevant to each service. One implementation could be like this;

* Whenever a record event occurs, it gets broadcast through event bus.

* Event Store records all the data and we use it only for recording.

* If any service needs the data, it registers to catch the record event on the event bus. And record it to its own local database.

* When a service needs to retrieve the data, it uses its own local, read database instead of having to resort to event store.

Seperation of read & write databases makes the process fast and lean.

## Saga

Business transactions spanning multiple services require a mechanism to ensure data consistency across services. The Saga pattern manages failures, ensures consistency and correctness across microservices. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. Sagas are used as state machines that coordinate components of the whole. There are two types of saga implementation, both of these scenarios typically uses an Event Bus for communication, as the media for the event traffic. In my case, I used a choreography saga over an event bus.

### Event Broker Pattern - Choreography

There is no central coordination. Each service produces events when a certain action occurs. Each service knows how to respond to related events produced by other services. So the responsibility of the full transaction is distributed among relevant services. This is aided by an implementation of the Broker software architectural pattern.

### Event Mediator Pattern - Orchestration

There is a central service responsible solely for coordination of other services and the workflow. This is related to an implementation of Mediator software architectural pattern.

## Containers

Containers are brilliant technology that fits microservices architecture like a glove. From Docker website:
Docker containers are a key enabling technology for microservices, providing a lightweight encapsulation of each component so that it is easier to maintain and update independently. With Docker Enterprise, you can independently deploy and scale each microservice, coordinate their deployment through Swarm or Kubernetes orchestration and collaborate across teams through a consistent way of defining applications.
In my implementation, each and every database, tool, web service and consumer is encapsulated inside a docker container.

## RESTful Web Services

Representational State Transfer is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol. It revolves around resource where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. In my implementation, web services provide GET and POST methods only accepting and producing Json data.

## Platform Agnostic Integration

In microservices, it is important to be flexible and dynamic in your continuous development and integration. With that in mind, I designed my development environment so that:

* Any module can be implemented in any programming language as long as the established communication is satisfied.

* All services provide Rest API with Json objects. So virtually any consumer can communicate with them.

* The communication of the Event Bus uses Amqp protocol with RabbitMQ as the broker. Any module can communicate with the others as long as it talks Amqp.

* Any module can use whatever query database it wants to.

* There is a single Event Store, modules send write requests to this event store through Event Bus. So they don't need to know how, when and where the data is written.

* All modules are dockerized with Dockerfile and Docker Compose file provided. So they can be run on any host machine without having to know anything about it.

* All modules have a defined Docker network name. So they have their own network in which they communicate with each other. The host network is irrelevant as long as Docker runs on it.

To demonstrate that, I have implemented web services and consumers on a wide variety of platforms. The full list will be given later.

# The Software

The business domain I chose is one of the most classic ones so it is very easy to grasp: An ecommerce website. There are products and categories in it. Customers can register, login and browse products. Check their prices and purchase products. If their credit is sufficient and there are enough units in stock, the order succeeds. Product manager can log in to seperate website to edit products, categories and user credits.  
It is important to note that this sort of solution could be implemented, say, as a monolithic MVC application way faster and simpler. But we are going to use Microservices architecture anyway.

## User Stories

Template: As a [ USER ] I want to [ ACTION ] So that [ REASONING ]

User Personas:

1. Customer
2. Product Manager

Features:

1. View Products
2. Shop
3. View Order Status
4. View User Profile
5. Get Invoice
6. Modify products, prices, stocks
7. Modify user credits

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria  |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
|As a customer, I want to browse for products so that I can place an order.| View product categories<br>View Products<br>Ability to order each product<br>Get an Invoice|
|As a customer, I want to view my past orders so that it guides my future purposes. |View orders. Display order status, product info, order date|
|As a customer, I want to view my profile information so that I can make adjustments. |View user information and credit<br>Edit name, password, email|
|As a product manager, I want to add/edit/delete products so that customers can buy them|View/Add/Edit/Delete products. Names, prices, suppliers, units in stock |
|As a product manager, I want to view all customer order states so that I can assist if needed|View all orders and their states history in the system|
|As a product manager, I want to edit customer credit so that they can purchase products|View all users and their credit<br>Edit credits|

## The Design

(TODO)

## Aggregates

Business model that is sufficiently decomposed, simplified and satisfies all of the user stories is as follows.

![Aggregates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/microservices/aggregates.png)

## Communication Model

(TODO)

The key here is that everything worth recording must be first recorded on the Event Store since this is the source of all real data. The other databases are all just for reading.

## Event Bus Models

(TODO)

## Order Saga

This is the one and only saga that spans over all services. Everything begins when a customer likes a product and places an order. To keep messages simple, he can place 1 product at a time so there is no shopping chart. 

Prelude:

1. Customer places an order on a product
2. eCommerce website or eCommerce android application sends the request to reverse proxy.
3. Reverse proxy redirects the requests to Order web service
4. Order Web service starts the Order Saga

The Order choreography:

![Order Saga]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/microservices/ordersaga.png)

I have excluded some of the rollback transactions. The only checks here are if the product is in store and if the user has enough credits to buy it.

1. Order service sends a message to Event Store, saying that it wants to place an order.
2. Event Store records the request. Tells Order service that the request is approved.
3. Since data is now atomicly recorded in the Event Store, Order service is now allowed to record the purchase request into its own database.
4. Order service starts the saga. Through Event Bus, it makes a broadcast to everything that listens to the saga events.
5. Product, Customer and Accounting services are interested in the saga. They asynchronously receive the event and respond to it.
* Product service checks if the product is in stock. Sends the price & stock information response back to the Order Service.
* Customer service checks if the customer has enough credit for the purchase. Sends the credit response back to Order Service.
* Accounting service does nothing. It is only interested in the final outcome.
6. Order service checks the responses and if product is in stock and the customer has enough credits, it approves the purchase but doesn't finalize yet. Sends the finalize request to Event Store.
7. Event Store records the purchase and responds to Order Service.
8. Order Service updates it Query database that the order suceeded. Then broadcasts to all recepients that an Order is successfully placed. The following events occur asynchronously.
* Product service reduces the units in stock.
* Customer service reduces the customer credit.
* Accounting service creates an invoice.

Before any real change to product, credit or invoice information, everything is first approved and recorded by the Event Store. It could cancel the transaction at any point with whatever criteria it wants. But I just made it a dummy service that records and approves everything.
