# The Software

The business domain I chose is one of the most classic ones so it is very easy to grasp: An ecommerce website. There are products and categories in it. Customers can register, login and browse products. Check their prices and purchase products. If their credit is sufficient and there are enough units in stock, the order succeeds. Product manager can log in to seperate website to edit products, categories and user credits.  
It is important to note that this sort of solution could be implemented, say, as a monolithic MVC application way faster and simpler. But we are going to use Microservices architecture anyway.

## User Stories
